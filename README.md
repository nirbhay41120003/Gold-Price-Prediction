# ü™ô Gold Price Prediction

**Gold Price Prediction** is a machine learning project that predicts whether the price of gold will increase or decrease based on various financial and economic indicators. This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction due to its robustness and accuracy in classification tasks.

## üìä Features

- Predicts the movement (up/down) of gold prices.
- Uses historical and financial market data as input features.
- Implements a **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction.
- Provides accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Historical gold prices and relevant features are collected.
2. **Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for modeling.
3. **Modeling**: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on labeled data (up/down).
4. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts future trends in gold price movement.
5. **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
